# PPGC
Old Standalone People Playground Map Creator

uh pretty much this is the unity project

instructions doc is helpful as well I guess


just some rules that would be nice to follow
1. please credit me for making the program, even if you heavily modify it or put it into another format using my code and stuff
2. description of maps can either credit me, aspa102, or dont credit the program at all
3. description of maps do not require the posting of the github link to any forks or the main github page
4. dont force people to use only your version of the editor, or try to cripple competition

ok thats generally it
